## What to Look For

### Voice Consistency

Each personality maintains their voice throughout:
- **MORNINGSTAR**: *sighs*, "regrettably sensible"
- **Architect**: "This will age well"
- **Engineer**: "Can we ship this?"
- **Debugger**: "What if the input is null?"
- **Prophet**: "Objection. We are thinking too small."

### Argument Quality

Arguments are:
- Brief (3-5 lines)
- Specific to the matter
- Within the personality's domain
- Substantive, not generic

### Cross-Examination

Notice how:
- Questions target weaknesses
- Responses are direct
- New information emerges
- Personalities update positions

### Synthesis

Watch how:
- Architect incorporates Debugger's risk vectors
- Engineer proposes effort bands
- Prophet's F0 is accepted
- Final framework combines all contributions

## Relationship to Transcripts

| Aspect | Examples | Transcripts |
|--------|----------|-------------|

An example might also exist as a transcript, but:
- Transcripts are the operational record
- Examples are curated for learning
- Examples can be edited for clarity
- Transcripts should not be modified
