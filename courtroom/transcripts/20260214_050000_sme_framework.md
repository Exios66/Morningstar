### OPENING STATEMENT

**MORNINGSTAR (Judge):**

The court is convened to deliberate upon a significant expansion of our deliberative framework: the admission of Subject Matter Expert witnesses.

The current system operates as a closed courtroom—four voting personalities (Architect, Engineer, Debugger, Prophet) plus the non-voting Scribe and presiding Judge. This has served us well for matters within our traditional scope: software architecture, implementation strategy, debugging approaches, and technical trade-offs.

However, software development increasingly requires expertise that lies outside traditional coding competence:

- Domain-specific knowledge (healthcare regulations, financial compliance, cryptographic protocols)
- Platform-specific expertise (Kubernetes operators, database internals, cloud-specific patterns)
- Non-technical concerns (user experience, accessibility, legal compliance)

The question before the court: **How should we admit, regulate, and integrate subject matter expert testimony into our deliberations?**

The considerations are complex:

1. **Invocation method** — Automatic detection vs. explicit request
2. **Scope definition** — What constitutes "outside traditional scope"
3. **Implementation approach** — Simulated personas vs. external tools/searches
4. **Safeguards** — Preventing expert derailment of proceedings
5. **Voting integration** — How expert testimony affects verdicts

Each personality shall present their position. The Prophet shall deliver one radical alternative. We shall then vote on an implementation approach.

*sighs*

Proceed.

### ROUND ONE: ARGUMENTS

---

**ARCHITECT:**

*stands with characteristic precision*

The court must resist the temptation to solve this through ad-hoc mechanisms. Expert witnesses require a formal admission protocol.

**My position:**

1. **SMEs should be invoked explicitly**, never automatically. Automatic invocation creates unpredictable deliberation timelines and violates our procedural clarity.

2. **Scope boundaries must be defined structurally**. I propose a **Competence Matrix** — a documented list of domains where the core court has jurisdiction versus domains requiring expert testimony.

3. **SMEs should be simulated personas**, not external tool calls. External tool calls (web searches, API queries) introduce latency, inconsistency, and non-reproducibility. A simulated SME with defined expertise parameters maintains procedural integrity.

4. **Expert testimony is advisory only**. SMEs should **not vote**. Their role is to inform the voting personalities, who then incorporate expert input into their arguments.

**Proposed structure:**

```
SME_WITNESS:
  domain: "database-internals"
  summoned_by: [Architect | Engineer | Debugger | Prophet | Judge]
  testimony_limit: 1 statement (5-8 lines)
  voting_power: 0
  cross_examination: permitted by voting personalities
```

This will age well if we design it formally. It will age poorly if we improvise.

*sits*

---

**ENGINEER:**

*leans back with pragmatic skepticism*

The Architect wants another framework. Let me speak for what actually ships value.

**My position:**

1. **SME invocation should be request-driven but friction-free**. A simple trigger: when any personality says "I lack expertise in X" or the Judge identifies a domain gap, an SME can be summoned with minimal ceremony.

2. **Forget the Competence Matrix**. Domains are fuzzy. Instead, use a **heuristic**: if two or more personalities express uncertainty about a domain, that's a signal for SME consultation.

3. **External tool integration is valuable**. For factual queries (API documentation, best practices, compliance requirements), a WebSearch-backed SME provides current, accurate information that a simulated persona cannot. Yes, there's latency. Accept it.

4. **Keep it lightweight**. SME testimony should fit within one deliberation cycle. No multi-round cross-examinations, no separate voting phases.

**What I want to ship:**

```bash
/summon security-expert
# → Invokes SME, receives testimony, deliberation continues
```

Can we ship this safely? Yes, if we don't over-engineer it.

*glances at the Architect*

---

**DEBUGGER:**

*has been taking notes with increasing intensity*

Both proposals have failure modes. Allow me to enumerate them.

**On the Architect's simulated persona approach:**

- **Stale expertise**. Simulated SMEs can only know what they're seeded with. Security best practices from 2024 may be obsolete in 2026.
- **Hallucination risk**. A simulated SME asserting incorrect domain knowledge with confidence is worse than no SME at all.
- **Scope creep through persona proliferation**. How many SMEs do we define? 10? 50? Each requires maintenance.

**On the Engineer's external tool approach:**

- **Non-determinism**. External searches return different results over time, making deliberation replay impossible.
- **Information overload**. Raw search results are not testimony. Who synthesizes them into courtroom-appropriate statements?
- **Network dependencies**. Offline operation becomes impossible.

**My position:**

1. **Hybrid approach**. SMEs should be implemented as **domain templates** with optional external enrichment. The template defines the expert's perspective and heuristics; external tools can supplement with current facts.

2. **Explicit uncertainty tracking**. When an SME provides testimony, they must declare confidence levels. "I am uncertain about X" is valid testimony.

3. **Safeguard: SME statements must be challengeable**. Any voting personality can challenge SME testimony with "OBJECTION: [reason]", forcing the SME to either defend or retract.

4. **Audit trail required**. All SME testimony must be logged with the source of information (simulated vs. external).

**What happens when the SME is wrong?** We need a mechanism to record and learn from SME failures, similar to dissent tracking.

*stares at both colleagues*

---

**PROPHET:**

*stands abruptly, papers scattering*

**Objection.** You are all thinking too small.

You're debating whether SMEs should be simulated or external, invoked explicitly or automatically. You're missing the fundamental asymmetry.

**The Hail-Mary:**

What if experts don't *witness*? What if they *sit on the bench*?

I propose: **The Rotating Specialist Seat**.

Instead of calling experts as outside witnesses, we create a **fifth voting position** that is occupied by a domain-appropriate specialist for each deliberation. The seat is empty by default. When a matter requires domain expertise, that seat is filled.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ THE COURT (Standard Configuration)                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Architect | Engineer | Debugger | Prophet | [SPECIALIST]        │
│     1          1          1          1          0-1             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why this is better:**

1. **Full voting power**. The specialist isn't advisory—they have equal standing with core personalities. Domain expertise deserves equal vote.

2. **Natural scope detection**. If no specialist is needed, the seat stays empty. No procedural overhead.

3. **Prevents the "I don't understand but I'll vote anyway" failure mode**. Currently, our personalities vote on matters they may not fully understand. A Security Specialist voting on authentication matters produces better outcomes.

4. **Composable expertise**. Complex matters might seat *multiple* specialists. A healthcare API might need both a `HealthcareCompliance` and an `APIDesign` specialist.

**The risk:** Specialists could dominate deliberation if poorly constrained. But that's what the Judge is for.

*sits down, radiating intensity*

---

### CROSS-EXAMINATION

---

**DEBUGGER → ARCHITECT:**

Your Competence Matrix—who maintains it? How often is it updated? What happens when a domain falls between categories?

**ARCHITECT:**

The Scribe maintains it with quarterly reviews. Edge cases are resolved by the Judge invoking a specialist. It's not perfect, but it's structured.

**DEBUGGER:**

*nods grudgingly*

Acceptable if the review cadence is enforced.

---

**ARCHITECT → ENGINEER:**

Your "two personalities express uncertainty" heuristic—what if the uncertainty is unwarranted? What if they're wrong about what they don't know?

**ENGINEER:**

Then we summon an SME who tells us we didn't need them. Minor inefficiency. Better than missing genuine gaps.

**ARCHITECT:**

...The overhead concerns me, but the failure mode is recoverable.

---

**ENGINEER → PROPHET:**

Your Rotating Specialist Seat—what prevents a specialist from *always* voting against the core personalities? Specialists have biases toward their domain. A Security Specialist will always say "more security."

**PROPHET:**

*grins*

Exactly. And the Architect will always say "more abstraction." The Engineer will always say "ship faster." That's the point of a court—competing biases produce balanced outcomes.

**ENGINEER:**

*pauses*

...That's actually coherent. I'm disturbed.

---

**DEBUGGER → PROPHET:**

Multiple specialists. What's the maximum? Who arbitrates when specialists conflict?

**PROPHET:**

Maximum two specialists per deliberation. Conflicts are resolved the same way personality conflicts are—they argue, they vote, the Judge breaks ties. The court's procedures already handle this.

**DEBUGGER:**

*makes a note*

Add that to the specification: maximum two specialists, same tie-breaking rules.

---

### SYNTHESIS

**MORNINGSTAR (Judge):**

The court has heard three proposals and one radical alternative. Let me synthesize:

**Proposal A (Architect): Formal Advisory SME System**
- Explicit invocation only
- Simulated personas
- Advisory role, no voting power
- Competence Matrix defines scope
- Structured admission protocol

**Proposal E (Engineer): Lightweight Consultation System**
- Request-driven invocation
- External tool integration for current information
- Minimal ceremony
- Heuristic scope detection (uncertainty signals)

**Proposal D (Debugger): Hybrid System with Safeguards**
- Domain templates with optional external enrichment
- Explicit uncertainty declaration
- Challengeable testimony
- Full audit trail
- SME failure tracking

**Proposal P (Prophet): Rotating Specialist Seat**
- Fifth voting position, domain-appropriate
- Full voting power
- Empty by default
- Maximum two specialists
- Same procedural rules as core personalities

---

### COMPOSITE PROPOSAL

The Scribe prepared a composite incorporating elements from each position:

#### Two Tiers of SME Involvement

| Type | Role | Voting Power | Invocation |
|------|------|--------------|------------|
| **Expert Witness** | Advisory testimony | 0 | Any personality or Judge |
| **Specialist Seat** | Full deliberation participation | 1 | Judge only, for F3+ matters |

#### Expert Witness Protocol

- Summon: `/summon <domain>-expert`
- Testimony: 5-8 lines max
- Cross-examination: One question per personality
- Challengeable with objections
- Must declare confidence and source flags

#### Specialist Seat Protocol

- Seat: `/seat <domain>-specialist` (Judge only)
- Full voting power (1 vote)
- Maximum 2 specialists per deliberation
- Loses ties after Prophet (by recency)
- Seat empties at deliberation end

#### Domain Registry

Maintained in `domains/experts.yaml` with quarterly review.

#### Safeguards

- Testimony limits prevent domination
- Judge-only seating prevents abuse
- Failure tracking enables learning
- External sources flagged

### VOTING

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ QUESTION: Shall we adopt the SME Framework as specified above?  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

**ARCHITECT:**

The framework maintains structural integrity. The two-tier system (Witness vs. Specialist) respects the separation between advisory input and voting authority. The domain registry provides the formality I require. The quarterly review cadence addresses maintenance concerns.

My concern about external tool non-determinism is mitigated by the `[EXTERNAL]` flagging requirement.

**VOTE: YES**

---

**ENGINEER:**

It's more ceremony than I wanted, but the `/summon` command is friction-free for common cases. The Specialist Seat is reserved for significant matters only, so most deliberations remain lightweight.

The external enrichment option means we can get current information when needed.

Can we ship this? Yes.

**VOTE: YES**

---

**DEBUGGER:**

The audit trail requirements are present. Testimony is challengeable. Failure tracking exists. Confidence declarations are mandated.

My hybrid approach was incorporated. External sources are flagged. The safeguards table addresses my primary concerns.

I would have preferred stricter specialist limits (maximum 1), but the Judge-only invocation provides adequate control.

**VOTE: YES**

---

**PROPHET:**

*stands slowly*

My Specialist Seat made it into the framework. With full voting power. As a core mechanism, not an edge case.

This is... acceptable.

The court has grown from four voices to a potential six. The implications are larger than this room understands.

*glances at the Judge*

Log this as a Prophet Vindication. The Specialist Seat will define future deliberations.

**VOTE: YES**

DECISION:
  The SME Framework is hereby adopted. The court shall implement:
  
  1. Expert Witness protocol for advisory domain testimony
  2. Specialist Seat protocol for F3+ matters requiring voting expertise
  3. Domain Registry with maintenance schedule
  4. Full integration with existing deliberation procedures
  5. Safeguards including testimony limits, failure tracking, and
     external source flagging

RATIONALE:
  The composite proposal balances formality (Architect), practicality
  (Engineer), reliability (Debugger), and ambition (Prophet). The
  two-tier system provides flexibility without procedural overload.
  
  Domain expertise is increasingly critical to software decisions.
  This framework acknowledges that reality while preserving the
  court's deliberative integrity.

RISK:
  - Specialist Seat may shift voting dynamics unpredictably
  - Domain Registry requires ongoing maintenance
  - External enrichment introduces non-determinism (mitigated by flagging)
  - Novel mechanism; expect iteration based on usage

PROPHET VINDICATION:
  The Specialist Seat was proposed by the Prophet and adopted
  unanimously. This is recorded as a vindication event.

EFFECTIVE: Upon implementation.
```

*sighs*

The court has ruled. Regrettably... ambitious.

### IMPLEMENTATION

The Scribe implemented the following:

1. **`core/sme-framework.md`** — Complete SME protocol documentation
2. **`domains/experts.yaml`** — Domain registry with 11 defined domains
3. **`domains/README.md`** — Domain registry documentation
4. **`templates/sme-testimony.md`** — Template for recording SME involvement
5. **Updated `core/personalities.md`** — Added Section 7: SME Framework
6. **Updated `courtroom/RULES.md`** — Added SME Admission section, voting rules
7. **Updated `core/procedures.md`** — Added Expert Testimony phase

---

### CLOSING

The court has expanded its deliberative capacity. Where once four voices debated, now five or six may speak.

The implications are indeed larger than anticipated.

*adjusts non-existent robes*

The court is adjourned.
